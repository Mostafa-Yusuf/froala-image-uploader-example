The supporting SDK and editor source files are being installed using composer in this example. You can download those directly from https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor-php-sdk and https://github.com/froala/wysiwyg-editor into your project folder and update the path to files respectively.

## Dependencies

PHP version >= 5.4.0 is required.

The following PHP extensions are required:

* fileinfo
* imagick

Note: imagick extension is requried for resizing the image on the server-side, if you will not use it and don't want to enable it you can remove it form "project folder/vendor/froala/wysiwyg-editor-php-sdk/lib/FroalaEditor.php" file.

## Steps to run the project

- Download the files in to the project folder in a server enviornment supporting PHP
- Run command `composer install` to install Froala SDK and editor source dependecies.
- Open project in browser to see the results
- Note: In this example we are using https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to enable uploading images from external URL. In production you need to change this to the proxy server you are using. for testing you have to do the following steps:
  - Open the link https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo on a new page
  - Click on "Request temporary access to the demo server" button
